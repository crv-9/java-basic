Exercise 1
- In application:
- Sarah uses a stream to print all vehicles
- Kevin creates the stations step by step, instead of only one line.
- Kevin & I use a for loop to print them
- In abstract class PublicTransportVehicle
- Sarah used a stream to get the toString from each vehicle description.


Exercise 2
- Sarah used an enum for the credit cards
- I applied the credit cart types directly in the logic
- Kevin has a very lean CreditCardChecker class as he created a new class for the Luhn Algorithm.


Exercise 3
- Sarah used a stream to count red and blue cards - looks very lean
- I used a for loop for counting them
