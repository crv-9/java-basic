2.
3.


------------------
Exercise-specific comparisons and comments
------------------

>> Exercise 1
- Kevin didn't have a main
- Sarah used a find min and max value
- I used the sorting algorithm


>> Exercise 2
- Ali did all the operations in one class
- Sarah, like me, also has separated classes for each operation
- Sarah uses factorial

>> Exercise 3
- Ali used a simple test, not like me, as I used a parametarized test to cover more numbers

>> Exercise 4
- Same code

>> Exercise 5
- Ali uses the normal test, without using streams
- Ali has several private methods that contribute to the greater method

>> Exercise 8
>> Kevin did the average in another private method
